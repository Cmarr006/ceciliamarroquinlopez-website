        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Economics- Business Administration</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> There are many things about me that I can say. I gained a good work ethic from home and have carried that over into my professional life. Through the years I’ve realized that I appreciate an environment that makes me feel fulfilled and happy. I currently work as a receptionist in an assisted living home where I can work quick on my feet as well as fulfill my social needs. I appreciate a workplace in which I feel helpful it can also learn every day that I am on the job. I appreciate new experiences as well as learning about the lives of the elderly I work for. Through these experiences I have had the pleasure of gaining many more skills that have helped me navigate my professional endeavors. Many of the skills I have acquired include Communication skills, Problem solving, Customer service skills, diffusion conflicts, answering multi lined phones, Sending, and creating emails and excel spreadsheets, Knowledge with Ilearn and Kronos Workplace, as well as file keeping and purging, organizational skills and much more. Much like I previously stated there are many things that make a job fulfilling to me, thankfully the job I currently possess is something that I wish to later mention in my career. Eldercare has been a big part of shaping my professional as well as personal attitude towards life. For example, I feel after having this job I have learned to be able to separate my work and personal life; this is important because to be there for the people I work for I cannot allow my outside feelings to cloud my judgement. Finally, I learned that many times when I’m in a professional setting I adapt very easily to the environment and attempt to make sure that everything I do is of benefit of myself and the individuals I work for. For example, the company I currently work for allows me to make personal connections with the people living here as well as work here. The friendly and family environment gives me a sense of purpose as well as appreciation which is a quality, I look for to want to work harder. This in turn helps me understand that I prefer a more intimate workplace in which I am able to form healthy professional relationships. I have been describing a lot about what I like professionally, but personally I just appreciate talking and meeting new people. I have always been a bubbly and outgoing person, so I value human connections and conversations a lot. I believe that we can learn a lot from each other in order to be able to understand each other a lot more. Thankfully I have been granted the opportunity to flourish in these types of enriching environments, and hope to continue being offered opportunities such as this ones in my professional career. This was just a small description to introduce myself and hopefully be considered for the position you are offering if anyone has any further questions please don’t hesitate to ask or contact me.  <br><br>
